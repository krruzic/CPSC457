# CPSC457
Assignments from 457
Repo containing the three assignments from this course. Inside each directory is a short readme describing what the program does.
I'll post the assignment descriptions/goals later. 

A1 is a simple device driver to generate a CRC for each process currently running. A2 is a Linux kernel module and an associated syscall to attach tags to PIDs. A script is also included to run `kill` given a tag. A3 is a coffee shop simulator to test different lineup approaches using multithreading (pthreads).
