README
=============
Hi again. This part is also completed. Everything works I am pretty sure. So in this program just compile with make, insert with modprobe or insmod crcdev. 
After you've done that you're going to want to attempt a read, to get the task information you're looking for.
sudo cat /dev/crcdev works well for this. Check to see if it worked by reading /var/log/messages
Another important thing is writing. What happens when you attempt a write?! Well I wrote a C program that let's you easily
write to the device. Run test.o with an argument of whatever and check the log again. 
Hopefully you'll see the error message. Oh PS the checksums are printed as hex. 
Another thing: if the task has no mm, I set the pgd to 0 and then include it in the checksum calculation.
Questions:
1) Remove the parts that change all the time. This includes state, and ptrace.
2) sudo modprobe crcdev
   sudo cat /dev/crcdev #(READ TO DEVICE)
   sudo cat /var/log/message #(PRINT THE MESSAGE LOG)

	Something like that. You can check yourself using the above stuff.
   sudo ./test TEST #(TEST WRITING)
   sudo cat /var/log/message #(PRINT THE MESSAGE LOG)
   Oct 17 14:10:55 cpsc457 kernel: EINVAL, Operation not permitted: Device does not support writing
=============
I return an error (EINVAL) but it doesn't have the expected behaviour (writing to the console). Whatevs
PS: gibe good mark pls
